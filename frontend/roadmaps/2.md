# Gmail API Configuration and Email Forwarding

This guide provides instructions on how to programmatically configure Gmail to forward emails from any configured user's account to your Azure Function webhook using the Gmail API.

## Set up Gmail API access

1. Enable the Gmail API for your project in the Google Cloud Console.
2. Obtain the necessary credentials (such as client ID and client secret) to authenticate and authorize your application to access the Gmail API.

## Authenticate and authorize the user

Implement the OAuth 2.0 flow to authenticate and obtain authorization from the user whose Gmail account you want to configure. Follow these steps:

1. Implement the OAuth 2.0 flow in your application.
2. Prompt the user to grant permission for your application to access their Gmail account.
3. Obtain the authorization token for the user.

## Set up email forwarding

Once you have obtained the user's authorization, you can use the Gmail API to programmatically configure email forwarding for their account. Follow these steps:

1. Create a Gmail API client using the provided credentials.
2. Define the forwarding address (your Azure Function endpoint).
3. Configure email forwarding for the user using the `Users.settings.forwardingAddresses` resource.
4. Call the Gmail API to set up email forwarding.

Here's an example of how to set up email forwarding using the Gmail API in JavaScript:

```javascript
const { google } = require('googleapis');

// Create a Gmail API client
const gmail = google.gmail({
	version: 'v1',
	auth: yourAuthClient, // The authenticated client object obtained after user authorization
});

// Define the forwarding address (your Azure Function endpoint)
const forwardingAddress = 'https://your-azure-function-endpoint';

// Configure email forwarding for the user
const userId = 'me'; // 'me' refers to the authenticated user
const resource = {
	forwardingEmail: forwardingAddress,
	verified: true,
};

// Call the Gmail API to set up email forwarding
const response = await gmail.users.settings.forwardingAddresses.create({
	userId,
	requestBody: resource,
});
```

Make sure to replace `'https://your-azure-function-endpoint'` with the actual URL of your Azure Function webhook endpoint.

## Repeat the process for each configured user

Iterate through each user in your application and repeat the authentication and email forwarding setup steps for their Gmail accounts.

# Azure Function Webhook with Azure Service Bus Integration

This guide explains how to create an Azure Function that acts as a webhook and pushes received information to Azure Service Bus.

## Table of Contents

- [Create a new Azure Function](#create-a-new-azure-function)
- [Implement authentication using @auth0/nextjs-auth0](#implement-authentication-using-auth0nextjs-auth0)

- [Deploy and test the Azure Function](#deploy-and-test-the-azure-function)

## Set up an Azure Function App

1. Create an Azure Function App in the Azure portal. This will serve as the hosting environment for your webhook function.

## Create a new Azure Function

Within your Azure Function App, create a new HTTP-triggered function.

 This function will handle the incoming webhook requests.

## Implement authentication using @auth0/nextjs-auth0

Follow the documentation provided by @auth0/nextjs-auth0 to integrate authentication into your Azure Function. This will ensure that only authenticated users can access your webhook endpoint.

## Configure Azure Service Bus connection

In the Azure portal, obtain the connection string for your Azure Service Bus namespace or create a new one if you haven't already. This connection string will be used to establish a connection to Azure Service Bus.

## Install required dependencies

Inside your Azure Function project, install the necessary dependencies to work with Azure Service Bus. You can use the `@azure/service-bus` package for interacting with Azure Service Bus. Run the following command in your project directory:

```
npm install @azure/service-bus
```

## Write the Azure Function code

Implement the Azure Function code to handle the incoming webhook requests, authenticate the requests using @auth0/nextjs-auth0, and push the received information to Azure Service Bus. Here's an example code snippet:

```javascript
const { ServiceBusClient } = require("@azure/service-bus");

module.exports = async function (context, req) {
  // Authenticate the request using @auth0/nextjs-auth0

  // Extract the received information from the request

  // Push the information to Azure Service Bus
  const connectionString = "YOUR_SERVICE_BUS_CONNECTION_STRING";
  const queueName = "YOUR_QUEUE_NAME";
  const serviceBusClient = new ServiceBusClient(connectionString);
  const sender = serviceBusClient.createSender(queueName);

  try {
    const message = {
      body: "Information to push to Azure Service Bus",
    };

    await sender.sendMessages(message);
    context.res = {
      status: 200,
      body: "Message sent to Azure Service Bus",
    };
  } catch (error) {
    context.res = {
      status: 500,
      body: "Error sending message to Azure Service Bus",
    };
  } finally {
    await sender.close();
    await serviceBusClient.close();
  }
};
```

Make sure to replace `"YOUR_SERVICE_BUS_CONNECTION_STRING"` with the actual connection string for your Azure Service Bus namespace and `"YOUR_QUEUE_NAME"` with the name of the Azure Service Bus queue where you want to push the information.

## Deploy and test the Azure Function

Deploy your Azure Function to the Azure Function App and test it by sending requests to the webhook endpoint. Ensure that the requests are properly authenticated, and the received information is pushed to Azure Service Bus as expected.

Remember to handle any error scenarios and implement proper error handling and logging in your Azure Function code.
