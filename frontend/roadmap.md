Roadmap for Implementing Core Features and Adding Subscriptions:

Phase 1: Core Feature Implementation

- [ ] Set up infrastructure:
  - [ ] Create a server environment to host the application.
  - [ ] Set up a database to store user data and file information.
  - [ ] Set up Pinecone (a vector database) to store and query file embeddings.

- [ ] User Registration and Authentication:
  - [ ] Implement user registration and login functionality.
  - [ ] Use authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT) to ensure secure access.

- [ ] Knowledge Base Creation:
  - [ ] Allow users to create knowledge bases.
  - [ ] Implement the functionality to create a bucket in the cloud storage (e.g., Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage) for each knowledge base.

- [ ] File Upload and Embedding:
  - [ ] Implement file upload functionality, enabling users to upload files to their knowledge base buckets.
  - [ ] Extract embeddings from the uploaded files using a suitable embedding algorithm (e.g., BERT, Word2Vec).
  - [ ] Update the embeddings into the Pinecone database, associating each embedding with its corresponding file.

- [ ] File Deletion:
  - [ ] Implement file deletion functionality, allowing users to remove files from their knowledge bases.
  - [ ] Update the Pinecone database accordingly by removing the corresponding embeddings.

- [ ] File Analysis and Display:
  - [ ] Develop a frontend interface to display all files within each knowledge base.
  - [ ] Show relevant file information (e.g., name, size, upload date) for each file.
  - [ ] Implement a user-friendly file analysis view to display file content or insights.

- [ ] Chat Sessions:
  - [ ] Allow users to initiate chat sessions within each knowledge base.
  - [ ] Implement a real-time chat interface using technologies like WebSockets or a chat API.

Phase 2: Subscription Implementation

- [ ] Subscription Management:
  - [ ] Develop a subscription management system to handle user subscriptions.
  - [ ] Integrate with a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe) for secure payment processing.
  - [ ] Implement subscription plans and pricing tiers, including the $20/month plan for accessing all three knowledge bases.

- [ ] Upgrade and Downgrade:
  - [ ] Provide functionality for users to upgrade or downgrade their subscription plans.
  - [ ] Adjust access permissions and limitations based on the selected plan.

- [ ] Billing and Invoicing:
  - [ ] Generate monthly invoices for subscribed users.
  - [ ] Send notifications and reminders for upcoming subscription renewals.

- [ ] Account Management:
  - [ ] Implement account settings for users to manage their subscription details.
  - [ ] Allow users to update payment information and cancel their subscriptions if desired.

- [ ] Trial Periods and Promotions:
  - [ ] Implement a trial period or promotional offers to attract new users.
  - [ ] Provide limited access or discounted rates for a specified duration.

- [ ] Analytics and Reporting:
  - [ ] Set up analytics tracking to monitor user activity, subscription metrics, and revenue.
  - [ ] Generate reports and insights to track user engagement and plan effectiveness.

Remember to continuously test and improve your application throughout the development process. It's also important to consider privacy and security measures to protect user data and comply with relevant regulations.
