# Chat App Component

This is a reusable chat app component that provides a UI similar to popular messaging apps like WhatsApp or Telegram. It allows users to send messages and display a chat history.

## Installation

To use the `chat-app` component in your Angular, React, or Vue project, follow the steps below.

### Angular

1. Install the `chat-app` package via npm:

```bash
npm install chat-app
```

2. In your Angular module, import the `chat-app` module:

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { ChatAppComponent } from 'chat-app';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [ChatAppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  bootstrap: [ChatAppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

3. Use the `chat-app` component in your Angular template:

```html
<chat-app endpoint="https://api.example.com/messages"></chat-app>
```

Replace `"https://api.example.com/messages"` with the actual endpoint URL to call when sending messages.

### React

1. Install the `chat-app` package via npm:

```bash
npm install chat-app
```

2. Import and use the `chat-app` component in your React component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { ChatApp } from 'chat-app';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ChatApp endpoint="https://api.example.com/messages" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Replace `"https://api.example.com/messages"` with the actual endpoint URL to call when sending messages.

### Vue

1. Install the `chat-app` package via npm:

```bash
npm install chat-app
```

2. Import and use the `chat-app` component in your Vue component:

```vue
<template>

  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { ChatApp } from 'chat-app';

export default {
  components: {
    ChatApp
  }
};
</script>
```

Replace `"https://api.example.com/messages"` with the actual endpoint URL to call when sending messages.

## Props

The `chat-app` component accepts the following props:

- `endpoint` (required): The API endpoint URL to call when sending messages. This should be a string.

## Events

The `chat-app` component emits the following events:

- `messageSent`: Triggered when a message is successfully sent. You can attach an event listener to handle this event.

```javascript

To build and deploy a Stencil app, you can follow these general steps:

1. Build the Stencil app:
   - Run the build command to generate the optimized static assets for your app:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```
   - The build command creates a `www` folder that contains the compiled assets (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) of your Stencil app.

2. Deploy the Stencil app:
   - Depending on your hosting environment and deployment workflow, you can choose one of the following options:

     - **Static Hosting**: If you have a static hosting provider, such as Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or AWS S3, you can deploy your Stencil app by uploading the contents of the `www` folder to the hosting provider.

     - **Server Hosting**: If you have a server hosting provider, such as Heroku, AWS EC2, or DigitalOcean, you can deploy your Stencil app by following the specific deployment instructions for your hosting provider. Typically, this involves setting up a server environment, installing dependencies, and configuring the server to serve the compiled assets from the `www` folder.

     - **Serverless Architecture**: If you are using a serverless architecture, such as AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions, you can deploy your Stencil app by packaging the compiled assets as a serverless function. This involves creating a serverless function that serves the compiled assets from the `www` folder and deploying it to your serverless provider.

3. Set up routing (if needed):
   - If your Stencil app uses client-side routing (e.g., with Stencil Router), you may need to configure your hosting environment to support routing. This typically involves setting up URL rewriting rules to ensure that all requests are directed to the main `index.html` file of your app. Consult your hosting provider's documentation for instructions on configuring routing for your specific environment.

4. Test and verify:
   - After deploying your Stencil app, test it thoroughly to ensure that all functionality works as expected in the deployed environment. Test various scenarios, including navigation, API calls, and any other features specific to your app.

Remember to consider security best practices, such as enabling HTTPS, protecting sensitive data, and implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms if required.

Note: The deployment process may vary depending on your specific hosting provider and deployment workflow. Refer to the documentation of your chosen hosting provider for more detailed instructions on deploying a Stencil app to their platform.
